General Changes:


Villager HP scaling has been nerfed across the board:
-- Market Techs now only provide +20% villager HP instead of +35%
  -- Spirit and Eastern Medicines now only cost 90 Food instead of 120
  -- Great Coat now only costs 50 Food instead of 75
-- Pioneers now only provides +50% HP instead of +65%
-- Inca's Alpaca Wool now only provides +40% HP instead of +50% (armor bonus unchanged)

-- Apache Cactus Use now only provides + 10% HP instead of +15% (speed bonus unchanged). Cost reduced to 125W/100G from 150W/100G
