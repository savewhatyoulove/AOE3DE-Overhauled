For Windows:

Drop the "AOE3DE-Overhauled" folder in your local mods section for Age of Empires 3 Definitive Edition. 

This will be: C://users/yourusername/Games/Age of Empires 3 DE/16 Digit Number/mods/local

Launch AoE3:DE and go to the Tools section, then mods, and click enabled on AOE3DE Overhauled. 

Remove the folder to uninstall.

For Linux:

Copy the "AOE3DE-Overhauled" folder in a similar manner.

This will be (on a default steam install): 
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/933110/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Games/Age of Empires 3 DE/16 Digit Number/mods/local

If you use a custom install path, in the terminal, do 'find . -iname "*Age of Empires 3 DE*"' keeping the double quotation marks around "Age of Empires 3 DE". Install to that mod location as necessary.

Launch AoE3:DE via steam, go to the Tools section in game, then mods, and click enable on AOE3DE Overhauled.
