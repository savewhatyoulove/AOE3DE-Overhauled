Jungle Bowmen: 
-- Range increased to 18 from 16, no longer increases with unit upgrades

Explanation: Macemen were awful melee anti-cav units, being flatout worse than Skull Knights and Doppelsoldners. Now, they occupy the role of a melee grenadier, allowing them to clear out massed infantry and buildings with ease, but losing hard to artillery and anti-skirmisher units.
