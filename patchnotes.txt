General Changes:

Dock:
-- HP: Reduced from 2500 to 1750
-- Cost: Reduced from 200 Wood to 150

Inca Changes:

New Buildings Added:
-- Outpost. Cheap (50W) building with a large line of sight and no attack. Can only be built by Chasquis. Built limit starts at 1 and increases each age. 
-- Temple. Expensive (500F/W/G) building that can only be constructed by your War Chief. Generates a large trickle of Wood (6.0/s). Available in the Industrial Age.

Llamas: Given the increased importance of Llamas for Inca, I've greatly increased their build limit.
-- Build Limit: Increased from 20 to 40

Warchief:
-- Aura: Changed to a flat 10% damage amp for all units (the old one was lame and non-impactful. This way, it rounds out the native aura suite).

Kancha House:
-- No longer trickles food, now spawns 2 unfattened llamas when built.

Llama built limit:
-- Increased to 50

Shipments:
-- Sapa Inca: No longer grants your War Chief a native damage aura. Now, it changes his armor type to ranged from melee.
-- Tupac Rebellion: 
  -- Cost reduced to 1000 of each resource
  -- Ship time increased to 60 seconds from 40
  -- Plumed Spearmen now turn into Halberdiers instead of Musketeers
  -- Now properly techs Guard Dragoons
-- Son of Inti: Now additionally grants your War Chief's melee attack +0.5x AbstractCavalry/AbstractLightInfantry
