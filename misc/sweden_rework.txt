GOAL: To make Sweden not Japan 3.0 

Civ Focus: Sweden will have a heavy focus on melee infantry and melee cavalry alongside artillery, splashing in mercenaries and caroleans as needed. Torps will no longer be an omni villager, and Sweden's mixed villager comp will require micro/macro from the Swede player and planning from your opponent, as each one is strong/vulernable vs. certain unit types.
