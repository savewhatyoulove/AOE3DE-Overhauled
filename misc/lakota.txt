Civ Bonuses:

Khuwa replace villagers. Fragile but speed archers that excel at hunting, but cannot mine and are extremely vulnerable to cavalry raids. All buildings cost a combination of food and wood. You can build up to three Town Centers in the Discovery Age. Town centers are cheaper but have less health. Town Centers spawn bison over time for free, but you cannot build farms or estates. Khuwa cannot mind, but you start off with a market and have a fixed food to gold gather rate.
